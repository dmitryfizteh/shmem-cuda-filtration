The work deals with the development of a new approach for simulation of multiphase fluid flows in porous media. Computations of such flows are extremely important while developing technologies of oil recovery, constructing hydraulic
structures, solving ecological problems aimed at prevention of the soil and groundwater contaminat ion by petroleum products etc.
Used: C/C++, CUDA, MPI, SHMEM-library.
